* Introduction
Wallpapers and portraits are mainly used for 4K resolution monitors and linux windows managers handling. For example my ~raven2cz/awesome-config~ is using it.

In dir colorscheme, there are stored wallpapers driven by selected colorscheme.

Portraits are focus for notification messages, terminal colorscripts and generated wallpaper support.

* Ownership
Because I downloaded most of these from sites like ~wallheaven~ and ~alphacoders~, I have no way of knowing if there is a _copyright_ on these images. If you find an image hosted in this repository that is yours and of limited use, please let me know and *I will remove it*!

* License
The files and scripts in this repository are licensed under the *MIT License*, which is a very permissive license allowing you to use, modify, copy, distribute, sell, give away, etc. the software. In other words, do what you want with it. The only requirement with the MIT License is that the license and copyright notice must be provided with the software.
